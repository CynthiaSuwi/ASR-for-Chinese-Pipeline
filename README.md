# Automatic Speech Recognition for Speech to Text on Chinese

This is my [Google Summer of Code 2018 Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5284664500027392) with the [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/).

The aim of this project is to develop a working Speech to Text module for the Red Hen Labâ€™s Chinese Pipeline. In this project, a Speech-to-Text conversion engine on Chinese is established, resulting in a working application.
